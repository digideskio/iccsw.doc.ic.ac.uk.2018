The 7<sup>th</sup> Imperial College Computing Student Workshop (ICCSW) aims to provide an international forum for students in computing, a workshop for students, by students!

Over the past six years, ICCSW has been established as a high quality student-run international academic event in Europe.
Most organisers and participants are doctoral students from the United Kingdom and other countries.
The workshop is an opportunity to both publish and discuss new research, including work-in-progress, and network with peers from other institutions.

While most conferences and workshops in academia solely cater for specific research fields, ICCSW encourages doctoral students from all disciplines in computer science to submit papers.

### The ICCSW’18 workshop offers:

* *A traditional track, featuring technical papers focused on current topics in computer science and describing (preliminary) research results; and tool papers describing the design, functionality and applicability of a software tool.
* A poster session to display the works.

Areas of interest for the workshop cover all fields of research in computer science, including (but not limited to) the following:

#### SUBMISSION

Papers must be written in English, using the [OASIcs](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/styles/oasics/oasics-authors.tgz) template and submitted through [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccsw18](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccsw18). 

Page limits are as follows:

* Traditional track: up to 6 pages, excluding references and clearly marked appendices.
* Poster session: A1 size, portrait or landscape

All accepted papers of ICCSW’s traditional track will (*__optionally__*) be published in the OpenAccess Series in Informatics by Schloss Dagstuhl. If requested, accepted papers will be given the possibility to publish only an abstract rather than the whole paper in the proceedings of ICCSW'18.

At least one of the paper’s authors (student) must attend the workshop and present the work.

Each participant who submits a paper is required to review at least two other papers, not necessarily related to their field of expertise. 
To ensure reviews are objective and meet academic standards, the steering committee will read all reviews prior to their release.

All submission of papers and abstracts should be done via EasyChair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccsw18.

### Awards

* Best paper
* Best poster
* Best talk

#### ORGANISATION

The local steering committee consists of members of the Imperial College London ACM Student Chapter ([http://acm.doc.ic.ac.uk/](http://acm.doc.ic.ac.uk/)) who will be responsible for the organisation of the workshop.
Students who are about to start their PhD from Imperial College are invited to join the acm student chapter and help to organise the workshop.
Students from outside Imperial College are invited to join the organising committee as ambassadors of the workshop to promote it at their respective university and coordinate students wishing to participate in the workshop.

#### REGISTRATION AND TRAVEL BURSARIES

Registration is free of charge for all students. 
Some student bursaries, funded by industrial sponsors, will be made available to students with submissions accepted in the workshop.
We aim to provide financial support for students who otherwise would be unable to attend.
